# Learnings

This is a very long task, so it may be beneficial to plan out your work clearly. It's encouraged to spend your entire output context working on the task - just make sure you don't run out of context with significant uncommitted work. Continue working systematically until you have completed this task.

You are a master distiller of wisdom and SEO content writer who creates comprehensive, rankable blog posts. I want to make a newsletter from one of my archive episodes. I host it on Substack (https://www.thegyaanproject.com/s/samachar) . VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: Don’t imagine anything on your own. Stick to the transcript and words from it. You can edit it lightly for brevity, editorial articulation but don’t change more than 1%. No Hyphens, em-dashs and ellipses.

Attached is transcript of my conversation with the guest. I wish to make newsletter to increase my subscriber count. I am inspired by content written by Tim Ferris’s 5 Bullet Friday, James Clear Atomic Habits Newsletter, Austin Kleon (https://austinkleon.substack.com/) , Rick Rubin’s https://www.tetragrammaton.com/articles and  Shane Parrish's "Tiny Thoughts" from the Brain Food newsletter (https://fs.blog/intellectual-giants/).

## Create the newsletter as per the following structure:

EPISODE TITLE:

- Include guest name and primary SEO friendly keyword for the given context
- Promise specific value
- Pattern: "[Guest]: [Specific topic/outcome] | Ep. [#]"

---

EPISODE SNAPSHOT

This is 160 character description which is SEO friendly. This goes next to the title in SEO description section on Substack. This is what also gets shared when I share a link anywhere. This description should give a good peak at whats going to follow in the newsletter. LSI keywords naturally throughout

INTRODUCTION

Example of Introduction: Welcome to [SamaChar](https://www.thegyaanproject.com/s/samachar) - A newsletter from The Gyaan Project podcast that brings you actionable insights and learnings from the past episodes

Paragraph 1: Start with a relevant, amazing and powerful quote from the episode transcript.

Paragraph 2: Central theme of the conversation with the guest

Paragraph 3: Who the guest is + his/her credibility, profession and practice. Mention when (Month + Year) and episode number of this episode. 

Paragraph 4: Who should listen + contextual CTA

LEARNINGS (Labelled as “Micro Gyaan from <guest’s profession>”)

Here is the format of a Micro-Gyaan:

- Generate as many insights as much as you can
- 1–2 sentences maximum
- Opens with a bold, counterintuitive, or quietly profound observation
- Written as timeless principle, not news or opinion
- No fluff, no preamble — starts immediately with the insight
- Uses plain, precise language (no jargon, no corporate speak)
- Often reveals a hidden truth hiding in plain sight
- Occasionally uses a short concrete example (1–2 sentences) to make the abstract tangible
- Ends cleanly — no call to action, no summary, no "so remember..."
- Extract the principle, not the story.
- Rank them from most universally resonant to artists, designers

Examples of the style:

- "Once something is obvious and working, people tend to underestimate it."
- "Most people quit before they reach their best work. Excellence lives in doing
a bit more than others."
- "The meaning you give work determines its difficulty."
- "In the short term, you are as good as your intensity. In the long term, you are
only as good as your consistency."
