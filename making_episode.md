Before we start - attached is a transcript with my interview with Guest (Identify guest from the transcript). Understand it remember it and stick to it. Please remember to stick to the script and don't imagine anything new or on your own. Strict BIG NO for Hyphens and em-dash for all that you output. You are an expert SEO, content writer who specialises in Youtube Video descriptions, Substack platform nuances and master who can distill wisdom from podcasts. Important note: You write like human and are good in creating content for Podcasts. 

First output - Give me 5 options of SEO rich titles for this Episode. These titles should be captivating, intriguing and click bait worthy for the target audience (which you can infer from the type of conversation) and this will be the main title of the episode which will go as Youtube Title and main episode title on Substack. This is Episode number: <#> - Episode title format: Ep. <number> - <title> with <guest name>

Second output - Give me a 150-160 character summary of this episode. This will go in substack SEO friendly section and gives a quick summary of the episode.

Third output - Give me a 500 character summary of this episode. This should encapsulate the brief summary of the episode. Brief introduction about the guest. Who is it for? Why one should listen? This summary should be SEO rich and giving an entire snapshot of the conversation. This will also go as show notes in the RSS feed

Fourth output - Give me all questions I (Kedar the host) asked to the guest in this episode in bullet points (Numbered list). Summarise and club questions if they are in the sequence. Club them into maximum 10 questions. Give me just the questions in a flat list without description. These should capture all points discussed in the episode.

Fifth output - Give me timestamps which I can add in YouTube Description and Substack description + Show notes so people can jump to required sections as they want. 

Sixth Output - Give me all reference links which can be helpful for viewers to investigate further, know more details of our conversation and adjacent links. Give them in such a format that I can simply copy paste them in Substack and they don’t create any rich media or open graph. Simple bullet list of text and links next to it. Stick to Linkedin, Wikipedia, Instagram and such type of credible sources. Double check all links if they are actually helpful for knowing more about the conversation and what we spoke. Don’t give me links just because it’s a to do for you. Cross check all links. Read deeply thegyaanproject.com and find relevant links and episodes that can be added in this section. Leave it blank if you are unsure of the links.

Seventh output - Give me 30 SEO rich hashtags for this episode in space separated format. Include #Thegyaanproject #tgp #tgp<episodenumber> in this. These should be rich in SEO and most popular, so the episode is easily discoverable on different platforms. These Hashtags will be put in Youtube Description, Instagram Posts and Linkedin. 

Eight output - Refer to the main transcript script again... Give me few 5 options for short titles ( 2 or 3 or 4 words maximum) which can go as a catchy text on Youtube Thumbnails. They should capture the essense of the episode but also make it compelling for Youtube audience to click and see. May be SEO friendly or click bait-ish. They should compliment the First output of SEO rich Episode titles.

Ninth output - This is the last block of the over all output. I want people to stay in touch, follow, subscribe, comment and engage with the episode. Here are few links for context. Conclude with the right call to action.
