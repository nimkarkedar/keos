# Q&A
Give me all Questions and answers from the attached transcript. Questions which I (Kedar) host of the podcast have asked <Guest> (Guest on the show). Each questions should have 2 answers. One short answer and one long.
The Short answer should be 2 to 4 words maximum. This short answer should be quirky, funny, provocative and intriguing and making people curious to read the long answer - Here you can be little imaginative and think ultra hard.
The long answer should be 120-130 words maximum - explaining the real answer to the question.
Very important note - These questions and answers should be very human like conversation and in first person as if the guest is talking. And most importantly - Don’t imagine things, content and words. Stick to the original content in the transcript. Don’t use complex and long sentences - Keep it simple. Don’t use of en or em dash and hyphens (use brackets for context instead). Keep short sentences. Write everything in sentence case. The overall aim should be to convey the point of the speaker for a given questions as mentioned in the transcript, in the most precise and concise grammar and articulation.
