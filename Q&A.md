YOUR TASK:

Extract 4 meaningful questions that Kedar (host) asked the guest, focusing on:
- Creative philosophy and life perspectives
- Insights valuable to young Indian creatives
- Questions that explore depth, not surface-level topics
- Skip yes/no questions or purely biographical ones

For each Q&A, create:

**Q: [Exact question Kedar asked, lightly edited for clarity]**

**Short Answer (3-5 words):**
[A provocative, intriguing one-liner that creates curiosity]

Guidelines for short answer:
- Must be a complete, self-contained thought
- Quirky, counterintuitive, or philosophically charged
- Makes the reader think "Wait, what? Tell me more"
- Can be tangential but must connect to the answer
- Think: zingers, paradoxes, unexpected truths

Examples of the vibe:
- "Tension is a necessary evil"
- "A Jack of all trades is better"
- "14-second interactions"
- "Everyone should"
- "Honesty and authorship"
- "Rice and Rose"
- "Money"
- "What you see is not what you get"

**Long Answer (120-130 words):**
[Guest's perspective in first person, as if they're speaking]

Guidelines for long answer:
- Written in first person (I/my/we) from guest's voice
- Use ONLY content from transcript (paraphrase lightly for flow)
- No em dashes, en dashes, or hyphens (use brackets or commas)
- Conversational but articulate
- Must directly answer the question
- Include specific examples or frameworks the guest mentioned
- Natural reading flow
- End with the core insight

FORMATTING RULES:
- Use **H2** for main sections (OVERVIEW, numbered questions, CONCLUSION)
- Use **H3** for "Short Answer" and "Long Answer" within each Q&A
- Use > for blockquote on the opening quote in Overview
- **Bold** 2-3 key phrases in each long answer
- No em/en dashes or hyphens anywhere
- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences max)
- Use emoji numbers (1️⃣ 2️⃣ 3️⃣ 4️⃣) for questions

VOICE & STYLE:
✓ Simple, direct language (like talking to a friend)
✓ Active voice
✓ First-person from guest (I/my/we)
✓ Specific examples over abstractions
✓ Indian cultural context when relevant
✓ Conversational but polished

✗ No em/en dashes or hyphens (use brackets/commas)
✗ No invented quotes or content
✗ No corporate jargon or buzzwords
✗ No hedging ("I think," "sort of," "maybe")
✗ No American idioms unless guest used them

---

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Transcript is your ONLY source - do not add content
2. Every word in long answer must trace to something guest said
3. Short answers can be creative but must be defensible
4. Maintain guest's voice - their metaphors, examples, cadence
5. Focus on insights for young Indian creatives
6. Word counts are HARD LIMITS (160 for snapshot, 120-130 for long answers)
